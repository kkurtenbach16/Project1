            <p>The UW-Eau Claire Men's Club Volleyball team is a very successfull club at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire. We have had a top 10 finish in the nation at the division 2 level for the past 12 years. What's even more special about us is that we are a bunch of guys who can get together and play Volleyball. We accept all levels of experience, and a majority of the guys on the team started with very little experience! We have multiple events for teambonding that we do with the womens club and NCAA volleyball teams.</p>
