                <p>The UW-Eau Claire Men's Club Volleyball team is a very successfull club at the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire. We have had a top 10 finish in the nation at the division 2 level for the past 12 years. What's even more special about us is that we are a bunch of guys who can get together and play Volleyball while having a good time. We accept all levels of experience, and a majority of the guys on the team started with very little to no experience! We have multiple events for team bonding that we do with the Womens Club, NCAA volleyball, and our Alumni. We are part of the Wisconsin Volleyball Conference, and compete at the Division 2 level at the NCVF.
