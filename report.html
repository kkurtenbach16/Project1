<h2>Breakdown</h2>
<p>I belive that I have completed all of the tasks listed in the rubric. I communicated closely with my client, and did my best to meet the criteria listed. I did my best to make sure to add the responsive capabilites, but was forced to remove some of them so that I wouldn't have any warnings in my css or html. The form part was a bit tricky, but thankfully they were some online resources I was able to find to help me get that displaying and popping up correctly.</p>

<h2>Client Critique</h2>
<p>Overall, I think at first glance the website is appealing to me. The information that is provided on the home page is accurate and interesting. The only thing I would fix on the home page would be the video. Instead of a whole match, I would probably provide highlight clips of the team.

The Roster page is a little bland but I thought it was interesting that the provider was able to provide heights, position, and their hometown.

The image page was nice to see, the only thing I would recommend is that when you click on the picture it blows it up so you can really see it.

The contact page is nice to have as it allows viewers to reach out to you. 

Another plus that this website has are hyperlinks. All links are working and lead to the correct website.  

The volleyball team has some positions as president, Vice president, social media manager, treasurer. These positions could be put on the website some so other people know.</p>
